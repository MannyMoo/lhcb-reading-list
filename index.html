<p>Here you'll find reading materials for starting projects on LHCb physics. These are broadly grouped into two categories:</p>
<p><a href="detector.html">The LHCb detector</a></p>
<p><a href="physics.html">The LHCb physics programme</a></p>
<p>At some point this might evolve into something coherent.</p>
<p>For more general searches, INSPIRE-HEP has a comprehensive catalogue of physics papers: <a href="http://inspirehep.net/">http://inspirehep.net/</a></p>
<p>You can find all the LHCb papers by simply searching for my name and the LHCb collaboration, i.e.:</p>
