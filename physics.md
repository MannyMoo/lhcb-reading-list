# The LHCb physics programme

## General LHCb physics

These two papers are generic overviews of the main physics analyses done at LHCb:

[Roadmap for selected key measurements of LHCb](http://inspirehep.net/record/840887)

[Implications of LHCb measurements and future prospects](http://inspirehep.net/record/1127719)

## B physics

Latest measurement of time-dependent CP asymmetries in $B_d^0$ and $B_s^0 \rightarrow hh$ decays:

[First measurement of time-dependent $CP$ violation in $B^0_s \rightarrow K^+K^−$ decays](http://inspirehep.net/record/1246901)

Flavour tagging:

[Opposite-side flavour tagging of B mesons at the LHCb experiment](http://inspirehep.net/record/1090061)

Latest measurements of effective lifetime of Bs meson:

[Effective lifetime measurements in the $B_s^0 \rightarrow K^+K^− , B^0 \rightarrow K^+\pi^−$ and $B_s^0 \rightarrow \pi^+K^−$ decays](http://inspirehep.net/record/1303541)

Lifetime unbiased method of measuring effective Bs lifetime:

[Measurement of the effective $B_s^0 \rightarrow K^+ K^-$ lifetime](http://inspirehep.net/record/1123798)

There are also theory papers. In particular, we follow some papers by Robert Fleischer that detail some of the consequences of two body decays of B mesons, but these can be quite heavy going:

[Rare Decays and CP Violation in the $B_s$ System](http://inspirehep.net/record/1225118) (this is a nice review)

[Branching Ratio Measurements of $B_s$ Decays](http://inspirehep.net/record/1107732) (branching ratio measurements of heavy and light states)

[Effective Lifetimes of $B_s$ Decays and their Constraints on the $B^0_s-\bar{B}^0_s$ Mixing Parameters](http://inspirehep.net/record/928287) (effective lifetimes)

[In Pursuit of New Physics With $B^0_s \rightarrow K^+K^−$](http://inspirehep.net/record/875565) (new physics in Bs->KK decays)

[$B_{s,d}\rightarrow \pi\pi,\pi K,KK$: Status and Prospects](http://inspirehep.net/record/750118) (B and Bs_>hh)
