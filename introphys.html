<p>Paul Soler gives a lecture series on flavour physics and CP violation to SUPA postgraduate students across Scotland. You can download the material from <a href="http://www.ppe.gla.ac.uk/~psoler/SUPAFLA/">Paul's website</a></p>
<p>Download the lectures labelled SUPAFLA_2013_sect?.pdf</p>
<p>The first section is an introduction, section 2 is a generic section on CP violation, section 3 is on kaon physics, section 4 is on B physics and section 5 is on charm physics.</p>
<p>For general information about particle physics and all the different particles that've been discovered, please consult the Particle Data Group webpage and all the links from there:</p>
