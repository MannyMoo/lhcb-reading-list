# Introductory particle physics

## Recommended books

"Particle Physics", Martin & Shaw. I have a copy in my office (though it's currently missing). It's also available in the library or online [here](http://glasgow.summon.serialssolutions.com/2.0.0/link/0/eLvHCXMwfV1LSwMxEB5aRRAE37Q-oBe91X1ls9tDD6XuKp4EiwcvJdlMiwe3pV2pP9_Jo3UV6iUwTBhIspMZJt98CxCFd373z53AfMFTjilDEcYTIQJZyABlglxOVMx0-3N-z7Mhf3qLswasf5qlQZb29RAXwtaW9MZ5jsMAlWe1hl6wFB_Y_4Ez3IT-bELDA2Wh09nqVtEt299qV-F87i0Merhmfc3E7A2kLjwU1es7rrwXw9qTaGaxOEqa0CSJPGk02HgKJTEUeB0RmIkJmiidB6YlPiFHoiDLawJjTrAm18RAbqb_W2Y1vZ1PufvUrrIWG_Mj2EXdMHEMDSxPYM9ASovlKRw-u6-yY6snyzPo5Nlo-Nh1VsaudDSWus81CqKv6BwOhIbcl5VpzVMt6ERhkdIxcolSMUpMhOyl2NPvoJgoyjTa0N5q7-If3SXsW1CGrnNcwU61-MTrzQq_AVb6qeY), where you can read it in full in your browser, or download it as an ebook (but only as a 1 day loan).

"CP Violation", Bigi & Sanda. One of the standard texts on CP violation. Also available [from the library](http://encore.lib.gla.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2705177;jsessionid=3660DA4A59CDD3D4CA105E352EC3FC6B?lang=eng) (but not online).

"Discrete Symmetries and CP Violation: From Experiment to Theory", Sozzi. I've heard this is also a good reference for CP violation. Available online through the library, [here](http://glasgow.summon.serialssolutions.com/2.0.0/link/0/eLvHCXMwfV27SgQxFL2siiBY-MT1ASlsV5PJy9jJ7AxiZbGVzZLXiMXOgrMW_r252ZktVrRMAhcSSO7JzTknALy4o5OtMyFQoblO2dwwY42QlNlofHBCGuGkQq1yPVVVqV7eZDWCgZ85kDnwWp_QZC-v-uWXuP3ub_i99fjn9eOyW6KHLEWSZQL2ComTDD0L04Vp54Gi2f7siW2KMgjwuaBr6x2mWZESaO_SM7RR7YPA9n2wkMyJqD6CvYjqhGMYxfYE9jN_03encDv9SPs_AWDSfS8W-Zesjtg2kPKV4Nt7Xv8zIHU1K58nfeR5X7uZu7T_OIpl-TkcWuS8t6usjQsXQFK3aYR2jSyM8DQapUMU1vkmBO0lHcP4z3iX_4xdwcGaFYGFhmvYXX1-xZvNrH8ALASCgA). 

## SUPA flavour physics lectures

Paul Soler gives a lecture series on flavour physics and CP violation to SUPA postgraduate students across Scotland. You can download the material from [Paul's website](http://www.ppe.gla.ac.uk/~psoler/SUPAFLA/)

Download the lectures labeled SUPAFLA_2013_sect?.pdf

The first section is an introduction, section 2 is a generic section on CP violation, section 3 is on kaon physics, section 4 is on B physics and section 5 is on charm physics.

## Theses

The introductory chapters tend to give a reasonably accessible and comprehensive introduction to the relevant physics concepts, as well as an overview of the detector and data acquisition chain. 

[Constraints on Mixing and CP-Violation in the Neutral Charmed Meson System at LHCb](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1494111/files/Thesis-2012-Alexander.pdf), Michael Alexander. Including derivation of $D$ meson CP violation and mixing parameters.

[Performance of Hybrid Photon Detectors and Studies of Two-Body Hadronic B Decays at LHCb](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1232049/files/CERN-THESIS-2010-004.pdf), Laurence Carson. Including derivation of $B$ meson CP violation and mixing parameters. 

## The Particle Data Group

For general information about particle physics and all the different particles that've been discovered, please consult the Particle Data Group webpage and all the links from there:

[http://pdg.lbl.gov](http://pdg.lbl.gov)

In particular, [PDGLive](http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Viewer.action) contains a table of info on all known particles, eg the [$B^0$ meson](http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?node=S042).

## The Heavy Flavour Averaging Group

[HFAG](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/) produces averages of measurements relating to flavour physics, eg, mixing and CP violation parameters, CKM angles, etc. For example, [here](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/osc/spring_2016/#DMD) is the latest average of the mass difference between $B^0$ mass eigenstates, $\Delta m_d$, and [here](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/charm/Winter16/DCPV/direct_indirect_cpv.html) is the global fit of direct and indirect CP violation in the charm sector.
