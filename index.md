# LHCb projects reading list

Here you'll find reading materials for starting projects on LHCb physics. These are broadly grouped into three categories:

[Introductory particle physics](introphys.html)

[The LHCb detector](detector.html)

[The LHCb physics programme](physics.html)

[Analysis software](computing.html)

[Analysis beginner's guide](analysis-starter.html)

[Tips for reports & presentations](writing-tips.html)

[Glossary of terms](glossary.html)

At some point this might evolve into something coherent.


For more general searches, INSPIRE-HEP has a comprehensive catalogue of physics papers: [http://inspirehep.net/](http://inspirehep.net/)

You can find all the LHCb papers by simply searching for my name and the LHCb collaboration, i.e.:

`find a m alexander and collaboration lhcb`
